#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Honey
I am a full-stack software engineer with experience in medium-scale mobile and back-end applications, using a variety of coding languages, frameworks, and technologies. I am self-motivated and passionate about programming.

In my spare time, I am mostly adding new skills to my repertoire.
